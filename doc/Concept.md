# Description of tools and their purpose.

## Introduction

| Tool      | Introduction           | 
|-----------|------------------------|
|  Minikube | Used for deploying a local single-node Kubernetes cluster on your machine. It enables developers and administrators to experiment, test, and deploy applications in a local environment before deploying them to production.   |
| Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)  | Used for deploying local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers. It aims to provide a lightweight and easy-to-use solution for running Kubernetes clusters for development and testing purposes.  |
| K3s  |  ightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for resource-constrained environments, such as edge computing or local development environments. It aims to provide a simplified installation and management experience while maintaining full compatibility with the Kubernetes API. |
